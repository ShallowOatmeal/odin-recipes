        This cocktail was one of the early breakout successes at Milk & Honey, which was opened in 1999 by T.J. Siegal’s childhood friend, Sasha Petraske. Now served and enjoyed around the world, the Gold Rush is Siegal’s main claim to fame.
It’s an achievement made all the more remarkable considering that Siegal is not primarily a bartender. In fact, he came up with the idea for the Gold Rush not while standing behind the bar at Milk & Honey, but while sitting at it, sometime in 2000.
